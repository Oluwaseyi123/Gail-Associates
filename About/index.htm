                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>Gail Associates is a leading commercial Law Firm 
                        that delivers exceptional legal services in the diverse 
                        areas of Privacy & Data Protection, Startups, Business law, 
                        Arbitration, Oil & Gas, Banking & Finance, Capital Market, 
                        Tax, Litigation, Intellectual Property, Real Estate, 
                        Corporate - Commercial and Telecommunications law. 
                        The Firm's strong reputation is founded on its unique 
                        ability to provide innovative solutions to complex legal 
                        issues in a manner tailored to the client's individual needs. 
                        We adopt a visionary approach to client service which enables us to 
                        anticipate industry challenges before they arise positioning us 
                        ahead of our contemporaries.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
                    <p>We started with the conviction that law as it
                        is practised is dysfunctional and has become
                        mired in cynicism. The principal evil is the
                        business of charging for legal services on
                        the basis of the time spent doing it.
                        Time costing makes no sense - there is no connection whatever between the fees
                        charged and the value of the work done. It rewards inefficiency and tempts lawyers
                        to behave badly. From the client's perspective, it is uncontrollable and does nothing
                        more efficiently than generate unpleasant surprises.
                        
                        Legal costs are a business risk like any other. Our business is management of that
                        risk. We give our clients certainty as to their legal spending and we approach the
                        question of pricing with the client's specific needs and constraints in mind.
                        
                        We believe that our clients would like to pay us fairly for what we do and that a fair
                        sharing of risk and reward is conducive to a strong long term relationship.
                        
                        Finally, we want to enjoy our work, work with clients we enjoy, hang out with
                        colleagues we like and go home each day with a sense of genuine satisfaction
                        and reward.
