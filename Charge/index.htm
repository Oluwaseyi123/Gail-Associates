                        <p>We will charge you a fixed periodic fee (usually monthly) under either a global
                         retainer covering all your legal work or a specific retainer covering identified
                         aspects of the work. Unlike other firms, we are happy to include litigation in
                         the retainer.
                         
                         The retainer fee has no carve-outs or exclusions. It is calculated to equate to the
                         average value of the work over a long period, so as to smooth out the peaks and
                         troughs and give you budgeting certainty. Examples of specific retainers we are
                         currently working under include retainers for general commercial work, workplace
                         relations work and advertising vetting.
                         
                         The retainer fee is reviewed regularly to ensure that it is pitched at a fair level in
                         relation to the volume off  work.

                     <p>We charge a fixed monthly retainer during the preparation phase of the litigation
                         (i.e. up to but not including the hearing). This is calculated by working out the
                         likely total costs and spreading that out over the period that we estimate it is
                         likely to take before the hearing occurs. We can estimate both these factors quite
                         accurately.
                         
                         If there are periods where nothing at all happens (as is sometimes the case during
                         a lengthy litigation, for example while waiting for a hearing date), then you will
                         not be charged at all during those months.
                         
                         We then charge a separate fixed fee per day during the hearing itself. We do this
                         because the work involved during a hearing is substantially greater and more
                         intensely concentrated than during the preparation phase; and because most cases
                         actually settle before they go to hearing. This way, we protect you from paying
                         for the most expensive aspect (the hearing) if we help you to achieve an earlier
                         settlement.</p>
